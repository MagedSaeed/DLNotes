    "As previously mentioned, training a neural network is a very iterative process. The are many hyperparameters that needs to be chosen and adjusted iteratively. To take the most advantage of the data and find out the optimal values for the hyperparameters, the dataset can be split into three sets:\n",
    "- The training set. This is used to train the algorithm and its hyperparameters.\n",
    "- The hold out/cross validation/development set. This is used to test the algorithm and its parameters while searching for the optimal hyperparameters. This test set will be used multiple times through out the iterative process of network training.\n",

Having a very large test set may reduce the possibility to better exploit the data for further variations and patterns. Hence, usually, the ratio becomes that around 99% of the dataset is reserved for training, 1% for development, and 1% for test sets."
